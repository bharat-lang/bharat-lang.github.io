For the first time when you introduce programming to a person.

iterations, conditional execution, input, output.
Complete program structure. Writing code in multiple files.

- user defined functions, to extend the language.
- built-in functions and std libraries.
- code in multiple files.
- take input from user, files, URLs
- output on screen, files, URLs

All program to show-case these as examples for people to understand.

M#1.2:
Built-in methods.
List, set, dict, tuples, collections.
foreach-in 

Purpose of M2?
VSCode plugin for sample codes and plugin installation for visualization of the code.
PiPy module for running the programs.

Purpose of M3?
Language must support all the features needed for writing code for the program assignments to understand the fundamentals.
