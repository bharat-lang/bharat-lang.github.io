new programming languages 

for people of Bharat.

five programming languages   

that use the script of 

Bharat languages

---

## The Time

has come to do this. 

---

## Why?

Now Engineering colleges

have starting offering 

B.Tech degrees 

in regional languages like 

<em>Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Gujurati</em>.

## For whom?

We will make sure that 

these students get's started 

in these language to understand 

the computation models better.

instructing the computers, 

using their Mother Tongue,

GrandMother Tongue Samkrutam

and Aunty Tongue English.
